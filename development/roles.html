        <h2>Roles</h2>

        <p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Contributor</dt>
            <dd>submits changes</dd>
            <dt>Reviewers</dt>
            <dd>reviews proposed changes</dd>
            <dt>Committers</dt>
            <dd>performs final reviews and merges the changes</dd>
        </dl>
        </p>

        <h2>Path to Becoming a Committer</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Read:</b> Understand the project values and scope, the development philosophy and guidelines, and the change process. These contain necessary background information to be successful in Presto.</li>
            <li><b>Contribute:</b>  This will help you learn the codebase, and understand the development process. Start with something small to become familiar with the process.</li>
            <li><b>Review:</b> Once you become familiar with a part of Presto, start reviewing proposed changes to that part.  A committer will do an additional final review, and this will help you understand what you are missing in your reviews. At some point, your first pass reviews will not require additional changes during the final review.</li>
            <li><b>Committer:</b> The next step is to demonstrate an understanding of what you know and don’t know.  It is common for changes to require reviews from multiple committers, since no one person is familiar with all of Presto.  We are also looking for an understanding of the project values and technical vision.  Being a committer means reviewing and merging code in your areas of expertise from all contributors.  Committership is retained while being active in the project.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Duties of the Roles</h2>

        <p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Contributor</dt>
            <dd>Be responsive to comments and questions on your PRs.  Apply suggested changes and update the PR in a timely manner.</dd>
            <dt>Reviewer</dt>
            <dd>Be responsive to comments and questions on PRs you have reviewed. If a review is requested, respond, in a timely manner, to the request by either doing the review, or letting the contributor know when you can do it (or that you cannot do it). If you asked for changes to a PR, review the changes in a timely manner.</dd>
            <dt>Committer</dt>
            <dd>Review and merge changes from all contributors to areas you are familiar with.</dd>
        </dl>
